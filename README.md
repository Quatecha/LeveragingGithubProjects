# Leveraging GitHub Projects as an Alternative to Jira for Project Management

## Introduction:
GitHub Projects is a versatile project management tool offered by GitHub, providing teams with a collaborative platform for organizing and prioritizing tasks, tracking progress, and managing workflows. While Jira remains a popular choice for project management, GitHub Projects offers a streamlined and integrated solution, especially for teams already utilizing GitHub for version control and collaboration. This document aims to outline the benefits of using GitHub Projects over Jira and provide a guide on adding collaborators to GitHub Projects.

## Benefits of Using GitHub Projects:

### Integration with GitHub Repositories:
GitHub Projects seamlessly integrates with GitHub repositories, allowing teams to link project boards directly to issues, pull requests, and other repository activities. This integration fosters better collaboration and visibility across development tasks.

### Simple and Intuitive Interface:
GitHub Projects provides a clean and user-friendly interface, making it easy for team members to create, organize, and prioritize tasks using customizable project boards, columns, and cards.

### Automated Workflows with Project Automation:
GitHub Projects offers built-in automation capabilities, enabling teams to automate repetitive tasks, such as moving cards across columns based on predefined triggers or actions, streamlining project management workflows.

### Real-time Updates and Collaboration:
With GitHub Projects, team members can view real-time updates on project boards, collaborate on tasks, and discuss project-related matters directly within the context of the project board, fostering transparency and communication.

### Flexible Project Planning:
GitHub Projects supports flexible project planning methodologies, including Agile, Kanban, and custom workflows, allowing teams to adapt the project management approach to suit their specific needs and preferences.

## Navigating to GitHub Projects:

1. **Accessing the Project:** 
   - To navigate to GitHub Projects, log in to your GitHub account and navigate to the repository associated with the project you want to manage using GitHub Projects.

2. **Opening the Project Board:** 
   - Once in the repository, click on the "Projects" tab located near the top of the repository's page to access the project board.

3. **Selecting the Project:** 
   - Choose the specific project board you want to view or manage from the list of available project boards associated with the repository.

## Creating Team Planning and Retrospective in GitHub Projects:

1. **Creating a New Project:** 
   - Within the selected project board, click on the "Create a project" button to initiate the process of creating a new project. Choose the project template that best suits your needs, such as "Basic Kanban," "Automated Kanban," or "Automated Kanban with Reviews."

2. **Setting Up Columns:** 
   - Customize the project board by adding columns to represent different stages or categories of tasks, such as "To Do," "In Progress," "Review," and "Done." You can add, rename, or reorder columns to match your team's workflow.

3. **Adding Cards:** 
   - Create cards within each column to represent individual tasks, user stories, or features. Add details to each card, such as descriptions, labels, assignees, and due dates, to provide context and information for team members.

4. **Planning Sprint or Iteration:** 
   - Use the project board to plan and prioritize tasks for the upcoming sprint or iteration by assigning cards to team members, setting due dates, and organizing tasks based on priority.

5. **Conducting Retrospective:** 
   - After completing a sprint or iteration, use the project board to facilitate a retrospective meeting. Review the completed tasks, identify successes and challenges, and capture actionable insights or improvement opportunities using retrospective cards or columns.

## Adding Collaborators to GitHub Projects:

1. **Accessing the Project:** 
   - Navigate to the project board to which you want to add collaborators by following the steps outlined in the "Navigating to GitHub Projects" section.

2. **Inviting Collaborators:** 
   - Within the project board, locate the "Invite" button or option, typically found near the top-right corner of the project board interface. Click on "Invite" to initiate the process of adding collaborators.

3. **Entering Collaborator's GitHub Username:** 
   - In the invitation prompt or dialog box, enter the GitHub usernames of the individuals you wish to invite as collaborators to the project. You can also specify the level of access or permissions granted to each collaborator, such as read-only or read-write access.

4. **Sending Invitations:** 
   - Once you have entered the GitHub usernames and set the desired permissions for the collaborators, proceed to send the invitations by clicking on the appropriate button or option (e.g., "Send Invitations").

5. **Confirming Collaborator Addition:** 
   - The invited collaborators will receive notifications or invitations via GitHub, prompting them to accept the invitations to join the project as collaborators. Upon acceptance, they will gain access to the project board and associated project management functionalities.
